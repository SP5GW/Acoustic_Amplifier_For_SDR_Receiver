Scenario 1 Maximum amplification Measurement for Speaker Channel when amplifier 
is powered from none USB source

    Key parameters:
        Vcc = 12V
        fin = 1kHz
        Uin = max value, which does not cause output signal distortions
        Speaker impedance = 8ohm
        Speaker nominal power = 5W

Scenario 2 Amplifier -3dB Bandwidth Measurement for Speaker Channel when amplifier 
is powered by none USB source

    Key parameters:
        Vcc = 12V
        Uin = max value, which does not cause output signal distortions
        Speaker impedance = 8ohm
        Speaker nominal power = 5W

Measurement Method
    Step 1: Set maximum input signal level, which does not cause distortion of output signal,
    in our case there was no trace of distortion at maximum output of PC sound card. 
    This step is done at f=1kHz (the assumption is that 1kHz signal has maximum amplification)
    Step 2: Keep increasing frequency until output voltage drops by -3dB (equivalent voltage 
    drop of 0.7071Uout at 1kHz for linear scale)
    Step 3: When Uout drops to the level of 0.7071(Uout at 1kHz), which in our case is 
    3.76V*0.7071=2.66V, the coresponding frequency is upper -3dB cutoff frequency
    (10.6kHz in our case) for measured amplifier.
    Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3, but lowering frequency this time until Uout drops by -3dB. 
    In our case it was difficult to achieve such drop, but it can be assumed that it 
    happens approximately at 25Hz, which is lower -3dB cutoff freqency for our amplifier.

Scenario 3 Maximum amplification Measurement for Speaker Channel when amplifier 
is powered from USB source (high distortions of output signal)

    Key parameters:
        Vcc = 5V
        fin = 1kHz
        Uin = max value (value, which caused no distortions in S1 when amplifier
        was powered from 12V source)
        Speaker impedance = 8ohm
        Speaker nominal power = 5W

    Measurement Method
        This is essentially scenario 1, but this time amplifier is powered from 5V power source.

Scenario 4 Maximum amplification Measurement for Speaker Channel when amplifier 
is powered from USB source (no distortions of output signal)

    Key parameters:
        Vcc = 5V
        fin = 1kHz
        Speaker impedance = 8ohm
        Speaker nominal power = 5W

    Measurement Method
        Step 1: Set maximum signal level available from PC sound card (Uin)
        Step 2: Keep lowering it until there are no visible distortions to signal output from amplifier.
        This is max. Uin, which does not cause distortions when amplifier is powered from USB.
        In our case this is 680.5mV in amplitude.

Scenario 5 Maximum amplification Measurement for Speaker Channel when amplifier 
is powered from USB source (no distortions of output signal)

    Key parameters:
        Vcc = 5V
        fin = 1kHz
        Headphones impedance = 32ohm
        Uin = 670mV, level close to one which has been measured in scenario 4 
        (switch to speaker shall no caused distortions)

    Measurement Method
        Step 1: Set signal level of PC sound card (Uin), close to one which has been found in scenario 4 (670mV)
        Step 2: Measure output signal level for headphones. For headphones our amplifier in fact attenuates signal available 
        from PC card by about 40%. This is to have comparable experience when switching between speaker and headphones.
